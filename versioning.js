// my current version im using is ^4.21.2
//  4.21.2
// 4 -> major/breaking
// 21 -> recommended bugfixes, security changes
// 2 -> minor bud fixes (optional)
// ^4.21.2 => ^made 4 fixed, everthing after 4. can be updated without worries.

// if it is ~4.21.2 => 4.21 is fixed
// never use latest as version. as it updates major breaking version without consent
// Basically that's all about version control of node.
// More things are found at npmjs.com 
// It is a good habit to check documentation often.
